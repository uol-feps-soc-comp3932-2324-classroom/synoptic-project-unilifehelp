# Weakly Supervised Classification of Sustainability Themes in Product Descriptions and Customer Reviews

## Description

This repository is associated with the COMP3932 Synoptic Project. The project itself is an investigation of the performance of different weakly supervised text classification models for identifying sustainability themes of ecommerce products, both from the descriptions of those products and customer reviews. This repository demonstrates the entire process: cleaning and preprocessing of the datasets, training of each weakly supervised model, and their evaluation.

## Prerequisites & Installation


To setup an environment locally and install the required dependancies, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/uol-feps-soc-comp3932-2324-classroom/synoptic-project-unilifehelp.git;
    ```
2. Make sure a version of `Python 3` installed
3. Create a virtual environment.
    ``` sh
    python3 -m venv venv;
    source venv/bin/activate;
    ```
4. Install the dependancies
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt;
    ```

## Usage

The investigation process is composed of a set of Jupyter Notebooks for their interactive nature.

Make sure to select the virtual environment created earlier as the kernel when executing a notebook, so the required libraries are found.
